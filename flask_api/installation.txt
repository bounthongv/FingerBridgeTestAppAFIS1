### üìÅ Step 1: Extract and Locate the Application

1. Extract the contents of the installation `.zip` file to a suitable folder, such as:

   ```
   C:\FingerprintAPI\
   ```

2. Ensure the following file is present:

   ```
   FingerprintAPI.exe
   ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Enable Auto-Start on Windows Login (Recommended)

#### Option A: Add to Startup Folder (For Current User Only)

1. **Create a shortcut** of `FingerprintAPI.exe`:

   * Right-click `FingerprintAPI.exe` ‚Üí Select **Create Shortcut**

2. Press `Win + R`, then type:

   ```
   shell:startup
   ```

   and press **Enter**

3. **Move the shortcut** into the opened Startup folder.

This ensures the application runs every time the user logs in.

#### Option B (Optional): Start Minimized Using a Batch File

1. Create a file named `start_api.bat` with the following content:

   ```bat
   @echo off
   start "" /min "C:\FingerprintAPI\FingerprintAPI.exe"
   ```

2. Replace the path if your installation is in another folder.

3. Place a **shortcut to this `.bat` file** into the Startup folder (`shell:startup`).

This will run the app in minimized mode at startup.

### üß™ Step 3: Verify It Works

* After logging in or restarting, the **Fingerprint API bridge** should be running in the background.
* To verify, check that the app is active in **Task Manager** or monitor logs if available.

---

### ‚ùì Troubleshooting

* Ensure your antivirus or Windows Defender does not block the `.exe`.
* Do **not move** the `.exe` after adding it to Startup unless you update the shortcut too.
